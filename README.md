## Description
Our project is based in the sustainable agriculture/farm management space. The system will help farms keep organized records about the crops they grow and the certifications their farm has (ie. organic, non-GMO, etc.). Data is seasonal and can change over time, thus a centralized platform will help farmers review yearly crop records. Users are able to input information about their farms, including the field it is grown on, the types of crops, records of field conditions, and other miscellaneous things used like pesticides and records of irrigation. They are also able to update and delete their farm information, select specific fields based on attributes like area, fieldID and farmID, project specific columns from the ContainsField relation, look at which crop belongs to which farm, find the average irrigation used per field and the healthy fields, return the fieldID with the highest moisture and return fieldID that uses all pesticides.
